          One of my earliest memories about growing up in India was watching my grandmother, Ma, in the kitchen making <span class="bs-tooltip" uk-tooltip="title: Salted Fried Crackers">nimki</span> and khajoor, eagerly waiting for my share. I loved spending the hot summer days enjoying a kulfi underneath our mango trees, or
          sneaking into the kitchen to steal a taste of Mom’s <span class="bs-tooltip" uk-tooltip="title: Carrot Pudding">gajar ka halwa</span> and rabri. Holidays were something even more special: celebrating Eid with our next door
          neighbors, Rani Aunty and Ibrahim Uncle over various <span class="bs-tooltip" uk-tooltip="title: Vermicelli Pudding">seviyan</span>, and <span class="bs-tooltip" uk-tooltip="title: Festival of Lights">Diwali</span> with my family over besan ke ladoos and rasmalai.
        </p> 
        <p>
          It was these early memories of family and friends together over food that instilled my passion for enjoying food
          within me. When my family emigrated here to Texas in 1999, I realized that world was indeed going to be my oyster when
          it came to desserts. Being Indian, my family’s way of showing love is through food, and I knew I couldn’t wait to introduce my love of Indian desserts with others.  I have always loved how food has a way of bringing people together, we may come from different backgrounds, speak different languages, but we can put our differences aside and enjoy a meal together.
        </p>
        <p>So, instead of going the typical route of medicine or engineering like most Indians are expected to, I packed my bags and moved to Miami to pursue a degree in Int’l Baking and Pastry at Johnson & Wales University. While in Florida, I was fortunate enough to work with great companies such as Walt Disney World, Starbucks, and The Breakers Palm Beach. As much as I loved having the ocean in my backyard, some of the best Cuban coffee I ever had, I knew Texas would always be home and moved back to Plano.</p>
        <p>
          Since returning to Texas, I have worked as the pastry chef for The Dallas Fish Market, catering baker for UT Dallas,
          a Gelato Productionist for Paciugo, baker at Tart-a-licious, a sous chef at Edith’s, and currently in the pasty
          department at Eataly . I also began to compete in culinary competitions, and even won! My first competion was at Collin College with my Italian Wedding Cupcakes where I took home 2nd place. In 2018, my Lady Grey shortbread won me the title of Shortbread Champion 2018 at the Sherman Celtic Festival, and I retained my Champion title in 2019 with my Lemon Lavender!
        </p>
        <p>All of that is to say that I have a simple goal: to offer the best desserts to our community and made with only the highest quality ingredients. I hope you are as excited as I am to take your pallet on a culinary journey of traditional and infused Indian desserts.</p>
